# Gradient
Gradient Client, a 1.16.5 (future versions planned) client based off of wurst that offers a gradient of combat mods to hacks in highly customizable and intuitive GUI, and combines aldready several mods from open source clients, including baritone! Our theory on minecraft clients is, why choose between a hacked and combat client when you can have both! On startup, the client will give you an option to choose between 3 different sets of mods; a pvp client, a ghost client, and a hacked client, allowing you to use our client just about anywhere!
